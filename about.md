# About me

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />

My name is Karthik Velayutham, a junior at UT Austin studying Computer Science (Turing Scholars). This site is my safe space to freely post my ideas/thoughts as well as a portfolio (still need to set this up) for the various things I have accomplished in my 20 years of living.

I am passionate about systems-related work and anything low-level in general. Some of the projects that I have worked on: paravirtual OS, threading libraries, compiler for a low-level language, file-system for a virtualized OS, and a C-library for Merkle Tree-based hashing for faster build times (intern project at VMware).

Currently I am working in the [SPARTA](https://github.com/spartalab) lab under Dr. Boyles where I do cool research with transporation engineering simulations and parallelized optimization algorithms.

I am also working in the [UT Systems and Storage](https://utsaslab.github.io/) lab under Dr. Vijay Chidambaram, where I work with persistent memory crash consistency and various distributed systems research topics.
