description: Testing the Jekyll format
---

## Hello:

Well this is my first run at writing a proper blog that includes not only my personal portfolio but other things such as my thoughts and ideas. This is just a test blog and really my first time using Jekyll, a static blog generator. This theme was defintely not written by me. I actually combined two projects that I found on github to build this site which will contain the projects that I have worked on as well as my resume and probably future research related things. 
<div class="breaker"></div>


<div class="spoiler"><p>I just thought this was pretty cool so I'm giving it a test run. This is supposed to be like a spoiler so when you over your cursor over, the true contents will appear.</p></div>

I guess I'll see you later then.
