# General Motivations
January 5th, 2020

<br>
These days, it hasn't been very clear to me in what I want to achieve with my life, which is funny because 10-year old Karthik always assumed that he knew exactly what to do. Life is full of up and downs and I think that I'm just experiencing a bit of a dip. Yet instead of lamenting my feelings these days, I've been more and more thankful to the newer perspective. It reminds me of this quote by Haruki Murakami in "The Wind Up Bird Chronicle":
>_“The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you're supposed to go up and down when you're supposed to go down. When you're supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When you're supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there's no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up. If everything dries up, the world is darkness.”_

It's an interesting take on life, not one that the staunch tech-crazy aristocrats would believe in San Francisco (they're more obsessed with neo-liberal politics and a "grab life by its horns" philosophy). These days I have myself wondering if Murakami was right after all. Maybe instead of resisting the flow, I swim with the current and seize the opportunities that are to come.

The point is, I've decided to re-start this blog-format that I used to follow up with religiously in my middle school days (albeit, I talked a lot about tech then) to just discuss my life. This is a clear speaking board for myself. I wanted to hold myself accountable for the things that I want to achieve by keeping this platform as a constant reminder of the things that I've accomplished thus far, etc. By no means is this a page that I will be updating on a daily basis. However, if I can do my best to write a post every once in a while, then it'll mean something. That's the most that I can really hope for.
