## Thoughts on School:

It's been a while since I've actually kept this site updated in any way or form. I actually originally created this while I was in India so I didn't actually have that much time to put this together, but now I do have some time to chat. It's been about two months since classes started at UT and I do have to say that my classes are way more difficult than I anticipated. I am currently taking CS314H: Dat Structures and CS311H: Discrete Math and boy are these classes difficult. Firstly, the workload is pretty heavy, and adjusted to college has also been a pain that I am quickly adjusting to. We'll see how things go but so far I am having fun here at UT learning a bunch of new things as well as getting the chance to explore the amazing city of Austin with my friends. 

I plan to keep this blog a little more updated later on, but I don't have all the time to keep this constantly updated. I will try to cover the highlights of how everything is going, but for now, this is it! I'll talk later!
