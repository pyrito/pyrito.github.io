## The Rapid Pace of College:

It's been a while since I've actually kept this site updated in any way or form. I actually originally created this while I was in India so I didn't actually have that much time to put this together, but now I do have some time to chat. It's been about two months since classes started at UT and I do have to say that my classes are way more difficult than I anticipated. I am currently taking CS314H: Data Structures and CS311H: Discrete Math and boy are these classes difficult. Firstly, the workload is pretty heavy, and adjusted to college has also been a pain that I am quickly adjusting to. We'll see how things go but so far I am having fun here at UT learning a bunch of new things as well as getting the chance to explore the amazing city of Austin with my friends.

The first week of classes went by as I expected them to. Honestly, I didn't think college would be super different but I was quite surprised at how the entire situation is the opposite from high school. No one is forcing you to go to class and no one telling you to do anything. If you want to do well in a class you're going to have to put the work in and figure things out. I expected this, of course, but it was just slightly amusing to me how people would just leave in the middle of lectures and such. One of the core CS classes that I am taking this semester is Data Structures, a fundamental, yet rigorous class. We had a project given out during our first week! Nevertheless, I believe that these projects have been instrumental to my rapid growth over the last few months. I never expected to learn so much through seemingly simple projects, but I guess I surprised myself.

One of the most interesting projects that I have worked on so far is Tetris. Yup. Tetris. We had to make Tetris for CS314H. Now here's the thing: we haven't actually formally learned any data structures yet. As a result, this project was more on us for figuring out what we could use to best accomplish our goals. I'm going to be quite honest and say that the project itself was quite brutal but it was quite the learning experience. Testing the game for hours to get a working product was a rewarding process and I definitely understood more about CS as a whole through that process. 

I plan to keep this blog a little more updated later on, but I don't have all the time to keep this constantly updated. I will try to cover the highlights of how everything is going, but for now, this is it! I'll talk later!
