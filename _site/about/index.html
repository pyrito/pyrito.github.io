<p>My name is Karthik Velayutham, a software engineer at Katana Graph. I recently graduated with a B.S. &amp; M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, where I was a Turing Scholar. This site is my safe space to freely post my ideas/thoughts for the various things I have accomplished in my 23 years of living.</p>

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />

<p>I am passionate about systems-related work and anything low-level in general. Some of the projects that I have worked on: paravirtual OS, threading libraries, compiler for a low-level language, file-system for a virtualized OS, and a C-library for Merkle Tree-based hashing for faster build times (intern project at VMware). I’ve also been dabbling in data infrastructure work (scaling out dataframes, working with general purpose distributed computing tools such as Ray, etc.)</p>

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />

<p>In a previous life, I worked in the <a href="https://github.com/spartalab">SPARTA</a> lab under Dr. Boyles where I messed around with transporation engineering simulations and parallelized optimization algorithms. I also worked in the SCEA lab under Christopher J. Rossbach where I investigated heterogenous computing problems, specifically in the region of hardware accelerators (FPGAs) + graph analytics.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the electric bass (thank you to my amazing friends who purchased one for me), listening to music, running, and reading things on Wikipedia.</p>
