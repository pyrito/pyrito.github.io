I made it a goal to find some new hobbies to partake in for the new year, mainly because I think my life has become too monotone and focused on a final goal in life rather than enjoying the process that goes with it. My previous hobbies (music and science projects) had ulterior motives and I never really thought about how I could better as a person with these things. I‚Äôve come to realize that this mentality is wrong and I want to change myself for the better. I‚Äôm hoping that over the next few years I can develop a few hobbies that I‚Äôve started to touch upon.</p>

<p>(Like I‚Äôve said before, this blog is a platform for me to hold myself accountable for my lifestyle.)</p>

<h1 id="writing">Writing</h1>
<p>I never really took writing seriously until this past year, when I noticed how cathartic it really was. I‚Äôm naturally a pretty expressive person, but I can now kinda understand why writing is such a helpful medium. I have to think about what I‚Äôm typing, and this process has helped me reflect on my thoughts. As a result, I‚Äôve made it a goal to write more and put myself out there. If I was having a bad day, then write. If I was having a good day, I should write. I think it‚Äôs a good muscle to keep working out from time to time. After all, communication is a critical aspect in anything that we do these days.</p>

<h1 id="improv-comedy">Improv Comedy</h1>
<p>(Shout out to Ritvik for telling me to take this class!) I absolutely love improv. While some haters consider improv to be something that‚Äôs ‚Äúcult-like‚Äù for wanna-be comedians or actors, I don‚Äôt think they understand how terrifying the entire process is, especially for people who are not comfortable performing in front a group of random strangers. Imagine standing in-front of the girl you really liked from calculus and you start screeching animal noises (like the idiot you truly are) to fit the current scene. On one hand, you‚Äôre speedying up the match-making process because she‚Äôll have to decide whether she accepts the degenerate that you are (if so, good for you!) But on the flip side, being that vulnerable is truly <em>terrifying</em>. I cannot tell you how many times I‚Äôve gone to class, done absolutely nothing, and come back feeling terrible. However, with enough persistence, I‚Äôve been able to break that barrier of <em>not-caring</em>, and I can tell you that overcoming such a barrier is absolutely liberating. I think everyone should try something like this once. I hope to continue by joining an on-campus troupe or something.</p>

<h1 id="working-out">Working Out</h1>
<p>This is the classic stereotypical thing that everyone says they will do, but I really want to make the effort to go to the gym even during the days that I have boat-loads to do. After pushing myself to go to the gym a few times during exam week, I realized how much more effective I am in retaining information. Working out is another way to blow off some steam, and I think I need to hold myself more accountable and kick myself to go at least a few times a week.</p>
