<p>My name is Karthik Velayutham, a junior at UT Austin studying in Computer Science (Turing Scholars). This site is my safe space to freely post my ideas/thoughts as well as a portfolio for the various things I have accomplished in my 20 years of living.</p>

<p>I am passionate about systems-related work and anything low-level in general. Some of the projects that I have worked on: paravirtual OS, threading libraries, compiler for a low-level language, file-system for a virtualized OS, and a C-library for Merkle Tree-based hashing for faster build times (intern project at VMware).</p>

<p>Currently I am working in the SPARTA lab under Dr. Boyles where I do cool research with transporation engineering simulations (check out our GitHub!).</p>
