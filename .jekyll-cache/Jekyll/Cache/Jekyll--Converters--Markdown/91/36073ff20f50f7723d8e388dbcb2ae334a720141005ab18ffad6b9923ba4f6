These days, it hasnâ€™t been very clear to me in what I want to achieve with my life, which is funny because 10-year old Karthik always assumed that he knew exactly what to do. Life is full of up and downs and I think that Iâ€™m just experiencing a bit of a dip. Yet instead of lamenting my feelings these days, Iâ€™ve been more and more thankful to the newer perspective. It reminds me of this quote by Haruki Murakami in â€œThe Wind Up Bird Chronicleâ€:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>â€œThe point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when youâ€™re supposed to go up and down when youâ€™re supposed to go down. When youâ€™re supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When youâ€™re supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When thereâ€™s no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up. If everything dries up, the world is darkness.â€</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s an interesting take on life, not one that the staunch tech-crazy aristocrats would believe in San Francisco (theyâ€™re more obsessed with neo-liberal politics and a â€œgrab life by its hornsâ€ philosophy). These days I have myself wondering if Murakami was right after all. Maybe instead of resisting the flow, I swim with the current and seize the opportunities that are to come.</p>

<p>The point is, Iâ€™ve decided to re-start this blog-format that I used to follow up with religiously in my middle school days (albeit, I talked a lot about tech then) to just discuss my life. This is a clear speaking board for myself. I wanted to hold myself accountable for the things that I want to achieve by keeping this platform as a constant reminder of the things that Iâ€™ve accomplished thus far, etc. By no means is this a page that I will be updating on a daily basis. However, if I can do my best to write a post every once in a while, then itâ€™ll mean something. Thatâ€™s the most that I can really hope for.</p>
